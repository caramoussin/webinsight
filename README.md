# WebInsight

## Overview

**WebInsight** is a local-first platform for web content extraction, semantic enrichment, and AI-driven insights. Built with **Bun** and **SvelteKit**, it operates via a unified local server, ensuring user privacy, data ownership, and full offline functionality. The platform extends beyond traditional RSS aggregation by providing advanced web scraping, HTML/JSON parsing, and semantic analysis, powered by Fabric AI and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It features specialized AI agents‚Äî**the Archivist**, **the Scribe**, and **the Librarian**‚Äîto collect, summarize, and organize content into a personalized knowledge hub.

   ```

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

## Web Scraping Demo

Navigate to `/rss-demo` to explore the web scraping functionality:

- Enter a website URL
- Specify a CSS selector
- View scraped content in a card layout
- Process content with Fabric patterns via MCP

## Available Scripts

- `bun dev`: Start development server
- `bun run build`: Build for production
- `bun run db:generate`: Generate database migrations
- `bun run db:migrate`: Apply database migrations
- `bun run db:studio`: Open Drizzle Studio for database inspection
- `bun run lint`: Run code linting

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `DATABASE_URL`: Path to SQLite database
- `AI_API_KEY`: API key for AI services (optional)
- `MCP_SERVER_URL`: URL for MCP server (default: localhost)
- `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY`: Brave Search API key (optional)
- `BRAVE_SEARCH_TIER`: API tier ('free' or 'premium')

### Optional Brave Search Configuration

```typescript
// config/brave-search.ts
export default {
  enabled: false, // Set to true to enable Brave Search integration
  queryBudget: {
    monthly: 2000, // Free tier limit
    distribution: {
      archivist: 0.4, // 40% allocation
      scribe: 0.35, // 35% allocation
      librarian: 0.25 // 25% allocation
    }
  },
  caching: {
    enabled: true,
    ttl: 86400, // 24 hours
    strategy: 'memory' // or 'disk'
  },
  fallback: {
    mode: 'automatic',
    localOnly: true
  }
};
```

## Architecture

The Smart RSS Aggregator App follows a layered architecture with a strong emphasis on functional programming:

1. **Frontend Layer** (SvelteKit):

   - Components structure with UI (shadcn-svelte), feed, content, and AI components
   - Server-side rendering with SvelteKit
   - Reactive state management using Svelte stores
   - Functional reactive programming patterns
   - MCP UI for LLM management

2. **Backend Layer** (Bun + SvelteKit):

   - API endpoints in routes/api/
   - Core services including Feed Service, Web Scraping Service with Crawl4AI, and API Client Service
   - Pure functions with minimal side effects
   - Function composition for complex operations
   - MCP integration for AI pattern execution

3. **AI Layer** (Fabric AI with MCP):

   - Three specialized agents:
     - **The Archivist**: Collects content, extracts metadata using MCP pattern sequences
     - **The Scribe**: Summarizes content, extracts key points via Fabric patterns
     - **The Librarian**: Generates recommendations using MCP pipelines

4. **Data Layer**:
   - SQLite database with Drizzle ORM
   - MCP connection management
   - Immutable data structures
   - Pure data transformations
   - Encrypted storage for API credentials
