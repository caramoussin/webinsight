# WebInsight Requirements

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the core requirements for the WebInsight Smart RSS Aggregator application. It defines the problems the application solves, the target users, and the key features from a functional perspective.

## 2. Goals & Problems Solved

* **Goal**: Provide users with an intelligent, local-first tool to aggregate, process, and analyze content from various web sources (RSS, web pages, APIs).
* **Problem**: Information overload from multiple sources; difficulty in extracting key insights, summarizing content, and organizing information efficiently.
* **Goal**: Enhance user productivity and knowledge management by leveraging AI for content understanding.
* **Problem**: Need for privacy-preserving AI tools that operate locally without relying solely on external cloud services.
* **Goal**: Offer a flexible and configurable platform for content interaction.

## 3. Target Users

* Researchers, students, professionals, and knowledge workers who need to monitor and analyze information from diverse online sources.
* Users concerned with data privacy who prefer local data processing.
* Individuals looking for customizable AI-powered tools for personal knowledge management.

## 4. Functional Requirements (Features)

### 4.1 Content Aggregation & Collection

* **FR1.1**: Aggregate content from standard RSS/Atom feeds.
* **FR1.2**: Scrape and extract main content from web pages (HTML).
  * **FR1.2.1**: Handle dynamic, JavaScript-heavy websites.
* **FR1.3**: Fetch content from configured JSON APIs (e.g., Reddit, GitHub, X API).
* **FR1.4**: Manage content sources (add, edit, delete feeds, URLs, API configurations).
* **FR1.5**: Respect `robots.txt` rules during scraping.
* **FR1.6**: Provide mechanisms for handling rate limits for feeds and APIs.
* **FR1.7**: Allow users to configure scheduled/periodic data fetching with customizable frequency for automated content collection.

### 4.2 Content Processing & AI Analysis (Leveraging Fabric AI & MCP)

* **FR2.1**: Process extracted content using configurable AI patterns (from Fabric AI library).
  * **FR2.1.1**: Summarize content.
  * **FR2.1.2**: Extract key insights/wisdom.
  * **FR2.1.3**: Analyze claims or sentiment.
  * **FR2.1.4**: Extract metadata (tags, entities).
* **FR2.2**: Allow sequencing of AI patterns for multi-step processing (e.g., extract then summarize).
* **FR2.3**: Provide AI-driven content recommendations and organization suggestions (Librarian agent).
* **FR2.4**: Configure and manage connections to LLMs (local like Ollama, external like OpenAI) via the MCP UI.
  * **FR2.4.1**: Install/setup local LLM servers (if applicable).
  * **FR2.4.2**: Assign specific LLMs/configurations to different AI agents/tasks.
* **FR2.5**: (Optional) Integrate with Brave Search API for enhanced content enrichment and real-time web context.
* **FR2.6**: Allow users to configure AI processing pipelines with customizable patterns and sequences.
  * **FR2.6.1**: Support routines that can be scheduled and executed periodically.
  
### 4.3 User Interface & Experience

* **FR3.1**: Provide a clean, intuitive user interface for browsing aggregated content.
* **FR3.2**: Display articles/content in a readable format.
* **FR3.3**: Allow users to organize content into collections/folders.
* **FR3.4**: Implement advanced search and filtering capabilities (text-based, tags, source, etc.), potentially enhanced by AI features.
* **FR3.5**: Offer a responsive design suitable for desktop use.
* **FR3.6**: Support dark mode.
* **FR3.7**: Provide real-time updates (e.g., new content, MCP connection status) via WebSockets.
* **FR3.8**: Implement basic offline reading capabilities (Service Workers).
* **FR3.9**: Include a dedicated UI section for managing AI settings (MCP connections, LLM configuration, pattern assignment).

### 4.4 Data Management & Privacy

* **FR4.1**: Store all user data (feeds, articles, collections, configurations) locally.
* **FR4.2**: Use a local SQLite database for primary data persistence.
* **FR4.3**: Ensure user privacy by defaulting to local processing and local LLMs where possible.
* **FR4.4**: Provide options for data import/export.
* **FR4.5**: Securely store any necessary API keys or credentials.
* **FR4.6**: Implement basic data backup mechanisms.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

* **NFR1**: **Performance**: The application should be responsive, especially the UI. Background tasks (fetching, AI processing) should not block the UI.
* **NFR2**: **Reliability**: Fetching and processing should be robust, with appropriate error handling and retries.
* **NFR3**: **Privacy**: Prioritize local data storage and processing.
* **NFR4**: **Usability**: The interface should be intuitive for managing feeds, content, and AI configurations.
* **NFR5**: **Modularity**: The architecture should allow for adding new content sources, AI patterns, or features relatively easily.
* **NFR6**: **Security**: Protect user data and credentials stored locally.
