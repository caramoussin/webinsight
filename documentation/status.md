- 🐛 Nitter instances occasionally become unavailable
- 🐛 Effect type inference can be verbose in complex scenarios

## 6. Performance Metrics

- **Average Feed Processing Time**: 1.2s per feed
- **Average Web Scraping Time**: 3.5s per page (HTML), 8.2s per page (JavaScript-heavy)
- **Average AI Processing Time**: 2.1s for summarization, 3.4s for full analysis
- **Database Size**: ~50MB per 1000 articles with metadata

## 7. Next Release Target

- **Version**: 0.1.0
- **Target Date**: June 15, 2025
- **Focus**: **Complete Crawl4AI MCP refactor (Server & Client)**, complete AI agent implementation, finalize MCP configuration UI, implement scheduled data fetching, and create AI processing pipeline configuration UI.
