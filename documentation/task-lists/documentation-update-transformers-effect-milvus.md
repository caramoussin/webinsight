## Implementation Plan

The documentation updates will focus on accurately describing how transformers, @effect/ai, and Milvus Lite integrate into WebInsight's architecture while maintaining the project's privacy-first, local-first principles and functional programming approach.

Key components to document:

1. Transformer models for embedding generation and text processing
2. @effect/ai for managing AI operations with functional programming benefits
3. Milvus Lite as a vector database for storing and searching embeddings
4. Fabric pattern library usage for structuring AI tasks

All documentation will maintain a professional, collaborative tone and use clear, concise language with appropriate Mermaid diagrams where helpful.
