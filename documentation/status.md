## 5. Known Issues

### 5.1 Critical

* 🐛 None currently

### 5.2 Major

* 🐛 Occasional timeouts when scraping JavaScript-heavy websites - *May be impacted by Crawl4AI refactor.*
* 🐛 Memory usage spikes during AI processing of large articles
* 🐛 Complex error handling in Effect chains can be difficult to debug

### 5.3 Minor

* 🐛 UI rendering issues in dark mode for some components
* 🐛 Inconsistent metadata extraction for certain content types
* 🐛 Feed refresh sometimes fails silently
* 🐛 Nitter instances occasionally become unavailable
* 🐛 Effect type inference can be verbose in complex scenarios

## 6. Performance Metrics

* **Average Feed Processing Time**: 1.2s per feed
* **Average Web Scraping Time**: 3.5s per page (HTML), 8.2s per page (JavaScript-heavy)
* **Average AI Processing Time**: 2.1s for summarization, 3.4s for full analysis
* **Database Size**: ~50MB per 1000 articles with metadata

## 7. Next Release Target

* **Version**: 0.1.0
* **Target Date**: June 15, 2025
* **Focus**: **Complete Crawl4AI MCP refactor (Server & Client)**, complete AI agent implementation, finalize MCP configuration UI, implement scheduled data fetching, and create AI processing pipeline configuration UI.
